# Surprise Yourself

Just a small chrome extension that helps me open a productive task I can do when I am sitting in front of my laptop with a browser open and have some minutes to spare. Its best to keep small tasks as options here so that you dont end up not dreading the task.

This is mostly a learning project that I also get to use, I hope to add more things in the future like analyse how many times you visited a certain page that day etc.,
